Each graph shown will have a gist on GitHub. These plots use the `ggplot2` package, I recommended using the entire `tidyverse` package for `R` data handling.

### Comparing histograms

Used for comparing the distribution of a measure from a sample of a population compared to the rest of the population.

For example, this can be used to analyse and compare the distributions of the height of adults compared with non-adults.

### Scattergram

Used for plotting two variables where relationship may not be apparent.

For example, this can be used to plot the mean weight and the mean height of a population (and you should see a general positive correlation).
