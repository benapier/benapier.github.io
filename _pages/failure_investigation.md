## Introduction 

We offer an independent metallographic investigation into the failure of metals.  Our target is to find the root cause of a failure to enable understanding and what can be done to prevent potential future occurrences. 

## Expertise 

With over 75 years working closely with the metals sector we have developed an extensive understanding of metallography and how to interpret findings and relate results to industrial processes.  Our [metallographic laboratories](https://www.mpiuk.com/laboratories-metallography.htm) enable to us go into as much depth as required for any failure of metal.

## Methodology 

We offer three services for failure investigations, with bespoke options available upon request.

## Holistic failure analysis

The Institute can also offer a wider engineering failure investigation, which would include the above services and also analysis of the failure in context of the whole system to find long term solutions.
